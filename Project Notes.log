- I've discovered that if you have more consumers than producers (edited)
[2:33 AM]
Adding items wait section never hits
[2:33 AM]
but if you have more producers than consumers
[2:33 AM]
then remove wait never hits and add wait finally hits
then if they are equal they finally both hit

Producers: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
Consumers: 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 
add items waiting never hits
