- Implemented queue via vector same behavior as a real queue data structure (FIFO via push back and pop back)
- I've discovered that if you have more consumers than producers adding items wait section never hits
 * More producers than consumers then remove wait never hits and add wait finally hits
 * If they are equal they finally both hit

Producers: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
Consumers: 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 
add items waiting never hits
